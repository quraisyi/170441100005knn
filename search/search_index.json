However, as you write your documentation, you may reach a point where some small adjustments are necessary to preserve the desired style. Adding assets \u00b6 MkDocs provides several ways to interfere with themes. In order to make a few tweaks to an existing theme, you can just add your stylesheets and JavaScript files to the docs directory. Additional stylesheets \u00b6 If you want to tweak some colors or change the spacing of certain elements, you can do this in a separate stylesheet. The easiest way is by creating a new stylesheet file in your docs directory: mkdir docs/stylesheets touch docs/stylesheets/extra.css Then, add the following line to your mkdocs.yml : extra_css: - 'stylesheets/extra.css' Spin up the development server with mkdocs serve and start typing your changes in your additional stylesheet file \u2013 you can see them instantly after saving, as the MkDocs development server implements live reloading. Additional JavaScript \u00b6 The same is true for additional JavaScript. If you want to integrate another syntax highlighter or add some custom logic to your theme, create a new JavaScript file in your docs directory: mkdir docs/javascripts touch docs/javascripts/extra.js Then, add the following line to your mkdocs.yml : extra_javascript: - 'javascripts/extra.js' Further assistance can be found in the MkDocs documentation . Extending the theme \u00b6 If you want to alter the HTML source (e.g. add or remove some part), you can extend the theme. From version 0.16 on MkDocs implements theme extension , an easy way to override parts of a theme without forking and changing the main theme. Setup and theme structure \u00b6 Reference the Material theme as usual in your mkdocs.yml , and create a new folder for overrides, e.g. theme , which you reference using custom_dir : theme: name: 'material' custom_dir: 'theme' Theme extension prerequisites As the custom_dir variable is used for the theme extension process, the Material theme needs to be installed via pip and referenced with the name parameter in your mkdocs.yml . The structure in the theme directory must mirror the directory structure of the original theme, as any file in the theme directory will replace the file with the same name which is part of the original theme. Besides, further assets may also be put in the theme directory. The directory layout of the Material theme is as follows: . \u251c\u2500 assets/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 images/ # Images and icons \u2502 \u251c\u2500 javascripts/ # JavaScript \u2502 \u2514\u2500 stylesheets/ # Stylesheets \u251c\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500 integrations/ # 3rd-party integrations \u2502 \u251c\u2500 language/ # Localized languages \u2502 \u251c\u2500 footer.html # Footer bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 header.html # Header bar \u2502 \u251c\u2500 hero.html # Hero teaser \u2502 \u251c\u2500 language.html # Localized labels \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav-item.html # Main navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 nav.html # Main navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 search.html # Search box \u2502 \u251c\u2500 social.html # Social links \u2502 \u251c\u2500 source.html # Repository information \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs-item.html # Tabs navigation item \u2502 \u251c\u2500 tabs.html # Tabs navigation \u2502 \u251c\u2500 toc-item.html # Table of contents item \u2502 \u2514\u2500 toc.html # Table of contents \u251c\u2500 404.html # 404 error page \u251c\u2500 base.html # Base template \u2514\u2500 main.html # Default page Overriding partials \u00b6 In order to override the footer, we can replace the footer.html partial with our own partial. To do this, create the file partials/footer.html in the theme directory. MkDocs will now use the new partial when rendering the theme. This can be done with any file. Overriding template blocks \u00b6 Besides overriding partials, one can also override so called template blocks, which are defined inside the Material theme and wrap specific features. To override a template block, create a main.html inside the theme directory and define the block, e.g.: {% extends \"base.html\" %} {% block htmltitle %} <title>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</title> {% endblock %} The Material theme provides the following template blocks: Block name Wrapped contents analytics Wraps the Google Analytics integration content Wraps the main content disqus Wraps the disqus integration extrahead Empty block to define additional meta tags fonts Wraps the webfont definitions footer Wraps the footer with navigation and copyright header Wraps the fixed header bar hero Wraps the hero teaser htmltitle Wraps the <title> tag libs Wraps the JavaScript libraries, e.g. Modernizr scripts Wraps the JavaScript application logic source Wraps the linked source files site_meta Wraps the meta tags in the document head site_nav Wraps the site navigation and table of contents styles Wraps the stylesheets (also extra sources) For more on this topic refer to the MkDocs documentation Theme development \u00b6 The Material theme uses Webpack as a build tool to leverage modern web technologies like Babel and SASS . If you want to make more fundamental changes, it may be necessary to make the adjustments directly in the source of the Material theme and recompile it. This is fairly easy. Environment setup \u00b6 In order to start development on the Material theme, a Node.js version of at least 8 is required. First, clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material Next, all dependencies need to be installed, which is done with: cd mkdocs-material pip install -r requirements.txt npm install Development mode \u00b6 The development server can be started with: npm run watch This will also start the MkDocs development server which will monitor changes on assets, templates and documentation. Point your browser to localhost:8000 and you should see this documentation in front of you. For example, changing the color palette is as simple as changing the $md-color-primary and $md-color-accent variables in src/assets/stylesheets/_config.scss : $md-color-primary: $clr-red-400; $md-color-accent: $clr-teal-a700; Automatically generated files Never make any changes in the material directory, as the contents of this directory are automatically generated from the src directory and will be overriden when the theme is built. Build process \u00b6 When you've finished making your changes, you can build the theme by invoking: npm run build This triggers the production-level compilation and minification of all stylesheets and JavaScript sources. When the command exits, the final theme is located in the material directory. Add the theme_dir variable pointing to the aforementioned directory in your original mkdocs.yml . Now you can run mkdocs build and you should see your documentation with your changes to the original Material theme.","title":"Customization"},{"location":"customization/#customization","text":"","title":"Customization"},{"location":"customization/#a-great-starting-point","text":"Project documentation is as diverse as the projects themselves and the Material theme is a good starting point for making it look great.

The fix includes a mandatory change of the base font-size from 10px to 20px which means all rem values needed to be updated. Within the theme, px to rem calculation is now encapsulated in a new function called px2rem which is part of the SASS code base. If you use Material with custom CSS that is based on rem values, note that those values must now be divided by 2. Now, 1.0rem doesn't map to 10px , but 20px . To learn more about the problem and implications, please refer to the issue in which the problem was discovered and fixed. Material 2.x to 3.x \u00b6 Material for MkDocs 3.x requires MkDocs 1.0 because the way paths are resolved internally changed significantly. Furthermore, pages was renamed to nav , so remember to adjust your mkdocs.yml file. All extended templates should continue to work but in order to make them future-proof the url filter should be introduced on all paths. Please see the official release notes for further guidance. Material 1.x to 2.x \u00b6 Material for MkDocs 2.x requires MkDocs 0.17.1, as this version introduced changes to the way themes can define options. The following variables inside your project's mkdocs.yml need to be renamed: extra.feature becomes theme.feature extra.palette becomes theme.palette extra.font becomes theme.font extra.logo becomes theme.logo Favicon support has been dropped by MkDocs, it must now be defined in theme.favicon (previously site_favicon ). Localization is now separated into theme language and search language. While there can only be a single language on theme-level, the search supports multiple languages which can be separated by commas. See the getting started guide for more guidance. The search tokenizer can now be set through extra.search.tokenizer .

If you use Material with custom CSS that is based on rem values, note that those values must now be divided by 2. Now, 1.0rem doesn't map to 10px , but 20px .

Naturally, the metadata is stripped from the document before rendering the actual page content and made available to the theme. Example: title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet description: Nullam urna elit, malesuada eget finibus ut, ac tortor. path: path/to/file source: file.js # Headline ... See the next section which covers the metadata that is supported by Material. Setting a hero text \u00b6 Material exposes a simple text-only page-local hero via Metadata, as you can see on the current page when you scroll to the top. It's as simple as: hero: Metadata enables hero teaser texts Linking sources \u00b6 When a document is related to a specific set of source files and the repo_url is defined inside the project's mkdocs.yml , the files can be linked using the source key: source: file.js The filename is appended to the repo_url set in your mkdocs.yml , but can be prefixed with a path to ensure correct path resolving: Example: path: tree/master/docs/extensions source: metadata.md Result: See the source section for the resulting output.

For this reason, the installation of this package is highly recommended as it's well-integrated with the Material theme. Installation \u00b6 The PyMdown Extensions package can be installed with the following command: pip install pymdown-extensions The following list of extensions that are part of the PyMdown Extensions package are recommended to be used together with the Material theme: markdown_extensions: - pymdownx.arithmatex - pymdownx.betterem: smart_enable: all - pymdownx.caret - pymdownx.critic - pymdownx.details - pymdownx.emoji: emoji_generator: !!python/name:pymdownx.emoji.to_svg - pymdownx.inlinehilite - pymdownx.magiclink - pymdownx.mark - pymdownx.smartsymbols - pymdownx.superfences - pymdownx.tasklist: custom_checkbox: true - pymdownx.tilde Usage \u00b6 Arithmatex MathJax \u00b6 Arithmatex integrates Material with MathJax which parses block-style and inline equations written in TeX markup and outputs them in mathematical notation. See this thread for a short introduction and quick reference on how to write equations in TeX syntax. Besides activating the extension in the mkdocs.yml , the MathJax JavaScript runtime needs to be included. This must be done with additional JavaScript : extra_javascript: - 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML' If you want to override the default MathJax configuration, you can do this by adding another JavaScript file before the MathJax runtime in extra_javascript which contains your MathJax configuration, e.g.: window.MathJax = { tex2jax: { inlineMath: [ [\"\\\\(\",\"\\\\)\"] ], displayMath: [ [\"\\\\[\",\"\\\\]\"] ] }, TeX: { TagSide: \"right\", TagIndent: \".8em\", MultLineWidth: \"85%\", equationNumbers: { autoNumber: \"AMS\", }, unicode: { fonts: \"STIXGeneral,'Arial Unicode MS'\" } }, displayAlign: \"left\", showProcessingMessages: false, messageStyle: \"none\" }; In your mkdocs.yml , include it with: extra_javascript: - 'javascripts/extra.js' - 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML' Blocks \u00b6 Blocks are enclosed in $$...$$ which are placed on separate lines. Example: $$ \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\binom{n}{k} $$ Result: \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\binom{n}{k} \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\binom{n}{k} Inline \u00b6 Inline equations need to be enclosed in $...$ : Example: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet: $p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)}$ Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet: p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} BetterEm \u00b6 BetterEm improves the handling of emphasis markup ( bold and italic ) within Markdown by providing a more sophisticated parser for better detecting start and end tokens. Read the documentation for usage notes . Caret \u00b6 Caret makes it possible to highlight inserted text . The portion of text that should be marked as added must be enclosed in two carets ^^...^^ . Critic \u00b6 Critic implements Critic Markup , a Markdown extension that enables the tracking of changes (additions, deletions and comments) on documents. During compilation of the Markdown document, changes can be rendered (default), accepted or rejected. Text can be deleted and replacement text added . This can also be combined into one a single operation. Highlighting is also possible and comments can be added inline . Formatting can also be applied to blocks, by putting the opening and closing tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content. Details \u00b6 Details adds collapsible Admonition-style blocks which can contain arbitrary content using the HTML5 details and summary tags. Additionally, all Admonition qualifiers can be used, e.g. note , question , warning etc.: How many Prolog programmers does it take to change a lightbulb? Yes. Emoji \u00b6 Emoji adds the ability to insert a -load of emojis that we use in our daily lives. See the EmojiOne demo for a list of all available emojis. Happy scrolling Legal disclaimer Material has no affiliation with EmojiOne which is released under CC BY 4.0 . When including EmojiOne images or CSS, please read the EmojiOne license to ensure proper usage and attribution. InlineHilite \u00b6 InlineHilite adds support for inline code highlighting. It's useful for short snippets included within body copy, e.g. var test = 0; and can be achived by prefixing inline code with a shebang and language identifier, e.g. #!js . MagicLink \u00b6 MagicLink detects links in Markdown and auto-generates the necessary markup, so no special syntax is required. It auto-links http[s]:// and ftp:// links, as well as references to email addresses. Mark \u00b6 Mark adds the ability to highlight text like it was marked with a text marker . The portion of text that should be highlighted must be enclosed in two equal signs ==...== . SmartSymbols \u00b6 SmartSymbols converts markup for special characters into their corresponding symbols, e.g. arrows (\u2190, \u2192, \u2194), trademark and copyright symbols (\u00a9, \u2122, \u00ae) and fractions (\u00bd, \u00bc, ...). SuperFences \u00b6 SuperFences provides the ability to nest code blocks under blockquotes, lists and other block elements, which the Fenced Code Blocks extension from the standard Markdown library doesn't parse correctly. SuperFences does also allow grouping code blocks with tabs . Tasklist \u00b6 Tasklist adds support for styled checkbox lists. This is useful for keeping track of tasks and showing what has been done and has yet to be done. Checkbox lists are like regular lists, but prefixed with [ ] for empty or [x] for filled checkboxes. Example: * [x] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit * [x] Nulla lobortis egestas semper * [x] Curabitur elit nibh, euismod et ullamcorper at, iaculis feugiat est * [ ] Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt * [x] In hac habitasse platea dictumst * [x] In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus * [x] Sed egestas felis quis elit dapibus, ac aliquet turpis mattis * [ ] Praesent sed risus massa * [ ] Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque * [ ] Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit Nulla lobortis egestas semper Curabitur elit nibh, euismod et ullamcorper at, iaculis feugiat est Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt In hac habitasse platea dictumst In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus Sed egestas felis quis elit dapibus, ac aliquet turpis mattis Praesent sed risus massa Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Tilde \u00b6 Tilde provides an easy way to strike through cross out text.
